<td align=left>Within the framework of the joint European Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) a 3029 m long ice core was drilled in Central Greenland from 1989 to 1992 at 72<sup>o</sup> 35' N, 37<sup>o</sup> 38' W. Polar ice cores contain a record of tha past atmosphere - temperature, precipitation, gas content, chemical composition,  and other properties.  The objective of the GRIP effort was  to reveal the broad spectrum of information on past environmental, and particularly climatic, changes that are stored in the ice. This information will help investigators understand the major mechanisms of the earth and man's  potential impact. <p></td>

Studies of isotopes and various atmospheric constituents in the core have revealed a detailed record of climatic variations reaching more than 100,000 years back in time.  The results indicate that Holocene climate has been remarkably stable and have confirmed the occurrence of rapid climatic variation during the last ice age (the Wisconsin).  Climatic instability observed in the core part believed to date from the Eemian interglacial has not been confirmed by other climate records.<p>

<td align=left>In the first drilling season in 1990, the drill reached a depth of 770m where the ice is 3840 years old.  In 1991, the drilling continued into 40,000 year old ice at a depth of 2521m, and on 12 August 1992, the drill hit bedrock at 3029m below the surface, where the ice is 200,000 years old or more.  The core is now stored in a cold house at the University of Copenhagen.  The GRIP deep drill is an updated version of ISTUK (IS means ice in Danish, TUK means drill in Greenlander).  ISTUK was constructed in 1978 and used successfully under the American-Danish-Swiss GISP 1 program at Dye 3 in South Greenland where it hit bedrock at a depth of 2037m in 1981. <p></td>

Although the actual drilling was completed in 1992, there was a last short field campaign in Greenland and at Summit to measure ice sheet strain parameters and to extend upward the GRIP hole so that detailed temperature and deformation measurements will still be possible. Using the experience accumulated through GRIP and the facilities of this last campaign, the successful development and testing of a special drill for the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) was also carried out. This new European drill will be able to operate in the much harsher environmental conditions to be found at Dome Concordia in Antarctica.<p>

It was possible to count annual layers in the GRIP core to obtain an excellent dating, particularly back to the Younger Dryas period.  Parameters used to date the core included ECM, dust, nitrate and ammonium, which all give excellent annual layers, particularly in the Holocene period.  Comparison with the previously dated Dye 3 core, using volcanic and other tie-points, provided a starting point.  Numerous volcanic eruptions were documented, allowing the possibility to make comparisons with other cores.  Deeper ice was dated using ice flow models.<p>

<h4><a name = "Measurements Made on the GRIP Core">Measurements Made on the GRIP Core</a></h4>

A huge number of analyses were made on the core in the field, while other samples were prepared in the field for shipment to laboratories around Europe.  measurements in the field helped scientists to select samples for special and urgen analyses, and to exclude the contamination risk from chemicals such as organic acids.<p>

<td align=left>Continuous measurements made in the field included dielectric profiling and electrical conductivity (related to the concentrations of neutral salts and acid).  Thin sections were made in the field to examine crystal sizes and fabrics.  Chemical measurements made continuously in the field were ammonium, nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, calcium and dust, while discontinuous measurements of other anions and cations were made by ion-chromatography.  Samples were cut in the field for oxygen isotope and deuterium analysis (with a resolution of about 3 cm in parts of the core), for trace gas analysis, for measurements of <sup>10</sup>Be, and mechanical properties of the ice, among others.<p></td>

The most dramatic finding from GRIP was that of the rapid climate changes (Dansgaard-Oeschger events) in the last glacial period.  These had been observed in previous cores, but GRIP confirmed their existence, their number, and the extreme rapidity of their onset in unprecedented detail.  Such work has stimulated paleoclimatologists in other fields to see how global these events are and to look for causes.<p>

<tr>
<td align=left>Among numerous other findings, new insights using markers of biological material have proved particularly exciting.  Methane has been found to change in time with many rapid climate changes.  Spikes of ammonium and organic acids  have been found to be markers for biomass burning, while background concentrations of these species indicate the advances of vegetation in North America. <p>

Measurements of borehole temperatures have allowed a re-calibration of the oxygen isotope-temperature relation for the GRIP ice core.  This work indicates that the temperature chnage at the end of the last glacial period was more than 20 degrees, a result found independently in the GISP2 borehole.  These increased temperature changes provide a renewed challenge to those seeking mechanisms for the transitions.<p></td>

The GRIP core offers a unique possibility to study the growth, rotation and recrystallization of polar ice at an ideal location, covering a time span of more than 100,000 years. This information is obtained by a comprehensive thin section study of crystal sizes and c-axis orientations along its entire length. The results confirm earlier, basic observations on deep ice cores and have led to new insights. A significant variation of crystal size with climatic parameters is shown to persist to a great depth in the core; the development of a strong crystalline anisotropy in the ice sheet is also demonstrated. Considerable insight is obtained into the rheological properties of the ice sheet from these studies.<p>

More detailed findings are reported in a large number of papers listed in this CD-ROM, and in the GRIP final report, available also on this CD-ROM.<p>

GRIP has been a multinational European research project, organized through the European Science Foundation (ESF). Funding came from 8 nations (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), and from the European Union. GRIP successfully drilled a 3028 meter ice core to the bed of the Greenland ice sheet at Summit.<p>

GRIP contributes to the aims of the IGBP PAGES program.  The GRIP data are held on the WDC-A Paleoclimatology server.<p>
