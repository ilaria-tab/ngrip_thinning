Assigning ages to measured depths in an ice core is an evolving process,
with timescales often changing to reflect new scientific developments.  It
is imperative, when comparing data from one ice core with another (or with
data from other paleoclimate records) that differences in the timescales
are taken into account.  The timescales used in specific publications may
not be identical to the ones provided on this CD-ROM.  If there are any
discrepancies, the original investigators should be contacted.  Comparison
of different parameters (e.g. chemical concentrations) within one ice core
should always be done on a depth - depth basis. 
<p>
There are three main timescales used on the CD-ROM.  For both GRIP and
GISP2, these timescales are in years before present (yr BP) where year 0
refers to <i>northern hemisphere summer of the year 1950 A.D.</i> For
example, year 1989 (summer) is be referred to as the year "-39 yr BP" on
this CDROM, following the convention of the radiocarbon dating method (see
e.g.  Stuiver and Reimer, 1993).  It should be noted that, in general,
GRIP publications have not used the A.D. 1950 convention.
<p>

In the case of GRIP, the currently accepted timescale is generally
referred to as the <a href = "../data/grip/depthage/gripage.dat">ss09</a>
timescale, and is based on a flow-modeling approach, constrained by annual
layer counting and other corroborative data.  Refer to the file <a href =
"../data/grip/depthage/gripage.dat">gripage.dat</a>, the document <a href
= "gripinfo.htm#Dating the GRIP Core">Dating the Grip Core</a> and the
paper by Johnsen and others (1997) for additional details.
<p>

In the case of GISP2, the official timescale, as of this writing, is the
<a href = "../data/gisp2/depthage/gisp2age.dat">Meese/Sowers timescale</a>. 
This timescale is based on annual layer counting and volcanic markers to a
depth of 2431 meters (about 50,000 years), using both the shallow GISP2
"B" core and the deep GISP2 "D" core, as described in Meese and others
(1994).  The Meese/Sowers timescale uses the <a href =
"../data/gisp2/depthage/bcoreage.dat">original B-core timescale</a> plus a
correction of 1.09 meters.  Below 2482 meters, dating is based on
comparison with the deep-sea sediment record, using the oxygen isotope
concentration in atmospheric oxygen in both the GISP2 and Vostok
(Antarctica) ice cores, as described in Bender and others (1994).  Between
2431 and 2482 a blend of these two methods was used.  Below a depth of
2808 meters (about 111,000 years ago) the dating is considered unreliable
because of the disturbed stratigraphy near the base of the ice sheet (see
e.g. Alley et al., 1995). Please refer to the file <a href =
"../data/gisp2/depthage/gisp2age.dat">gisp2age.dat</a> and the document <a
href = "gispinfo.htm#Dating GISP2">Dating GISP2</a> for additional
details.
<p>
The ages associated with data in each of the files on this CDROM are
derived from the most commonly used timescales for each core. For some
files, principal investigators provided age scales.  For most GRIP data
sets, we have calculated ages by linear interpolation from the <a href =
"../data/grip/depthage/gripage.dat">ss09</a> timescale.  For GISP2 data
sets, we have calculated ages from the official <a href = "../data/gisp2/depthage/gisp2age.dat">Meese/Sowers timescale.</a>

Also included on the CDROM, but not generally used in the data files, is
the layer-counted timescale of Meese et al. (1997), based almost entirely on annual layer counting via visual stratigraphy.  This is probably the most
accurate timescale to date.  More details on this timescale are given in
the file <a href = "../data/gisp2/depthage/countage.dat">countage.dat</a>.
