DATA DESCRIPTION: 

Laser light scattering (LLS) provides a fast, non-destructive, high-
resolution method for obtaining particle concentrations in bubble-free ice
cores.  LLS from meltwater was used to obtain dust concentrations along
the shallow portions of the core (<1650 m) before it was replaced by LLS
from the solid core. Some meltwater measurements were still made between
1650m and 2150 m.  Meltwater LLS data are given in the files m****.dat. 
Solid LLS data are given in the files s****.dat.  Each file contains 50
meters (not continuous) of relative intensity data. A compilation of all
of the solid LLS data, in approximately 1/2 meter averages, is given in
the file lightall.dat. 

DATA: 

All files have the following two columns: Column 1 = Depth (m) Column 2 =
Laser Light Scattering relative intensity. 

The parameters for the LLS from solid ice were as follows: 

		Beam diameter
Depth Range(m)	at center of ice (mm)	Step Size (mm)
1658 - 1987	8			2
1987 - 1988	1			1
1988 - 2251	1			1.5
2251 - 2551	8			1
2551 - 2817	1			1
2817 - 2820	8			1
2820 - 2832	3			1
2832 - 3040.35	1			1
