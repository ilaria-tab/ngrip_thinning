DATA DESCRIPTION: 

The included data sets are files for 500 mb and 700 mb atmospheric
trajectories for the Greenland Summit.  Each data set contains a month's
worth of data.  Each file is a backward trajectory for each month in the
year in both the 500 mb and 700 mb pressure fields.  Within each monthly
data file, the trajectory data are given as day/time followed by 241
latitude/longitude pairs (the first being the location of Summit,
Greenland, the trajectory arrival location).  Both latitude and longitude
are given in decimal degrees, with longitude in degrees E.  Each
latitude/longitude pair represents the trajectory position (at either 500
or 700 mb) at consecutive 1 hour times, extending backward in time 10 days
from the arrival time. Analytical details can be found in Kahl et al. 
(1997).

In summary: 

Monthly trajectory files for Summit, Greenland: 500 and 700 mb pressure 
levels.

Format of data:
	day/time    -     followed by 241 lat/long pairs (decimal degrees)

The time step is one hour for each lat/long pair.
The duration of each back trajectory is 10 days.  

The data files are located in two directories 500TRAJ  (500 mb 
trajectory fields) and 700TRAJ (700 mb trajectory fields).
