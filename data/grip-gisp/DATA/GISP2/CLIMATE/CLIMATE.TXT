DATA DESCRIPTION: 

The data files in the Climate directory Automated Weather Station (AWS)
data from 1987 - 1995 for stations distributed on and around the GISP2
site.  This data is received by satellite and accumulated by Service ARGOS
before being transmitted to the Data Processing group at the University of
Wisconsin - Madison.  The data comes in several forms.  The three-hourly
data for Greenland (detailed below) are corrected; that is, an effort has
been made to removed bad data points. The data are arranged in columns as 
follows:

temperature (degrees C)	
pressure (mb)	
wind speed (m/s)	
wind direction (azimuth degrees)	
relative humidity (%)	
vertical temperature difference (degrees C)

The vertical temperature difference is measured from 3.0m to 0.5m minus
the zero calibration.  Missing data are represented as 999999.  The 3 hour
original data files have been combined into one file for each station and
are a continuous record beginning at the time the AWS became active. 
Also, daily average files have been created from the original 3 hour
files.  No average is given if there were any bad 3hr data for a
particular day.  There were some changes in station location from year to
year, as detailed below. 

File names are identified by the latitude and longitude of the original
station location with an extension indicating either daily (.day) files or
3 hour (.3hr) files.  The original ARGOS identifier numbers (e.g. 8922)
and other details are as follows: 

Cathy:	8922 from May 1987 to May 1989.
	Note: Cathy moved 0.8 degrees west in May 1989
Kenton: 8922 from June 1989 to Jan 1995.
	Note: Kenton move 0.02 degrees in Jan 1991.	 
GISP2:	8936 from June 1989 to Sep 1991, 8925 from Oct 1991 to May 1992,	
	then back to 8936 from June 1992 to Jan 1995.	
Klinck: 8938 from Aug 1990 to May 1994, 8909 from June 1994 to Jan 1995.
	Note: Klinck moved from 72.58N, 40.50W to 72.31N,40.48W on Jan. 
	1, 1991.  The station filename is 72584050.3hr and .day.	
Barber: 8939 from July 1990 to June 1994, 8928 from July 1994 to Jan 1995.
	Note:  Barber station changes locations in Jan 1991 from 71.68N,
	38 deg.  20 min. W to 71.67N, 38.17W.  The filename is still
	71683820.3hr, and .day. 
 Julie: 8928 from Aug 1991 to June 1994, 8986 from June 1994 to Jan 1995. 
	Note:  station # 8986 and 8928 overlap by one month for the
	station named Julie.  Data for the daily averages for Julie used
	the data from station #8928.  The June 1994 file from # 8986 is
	available as a separate one month file.	
Matt:	8929 from Aug 1991 to May 1992, 8989 from June 1992 to Jan 1995.
