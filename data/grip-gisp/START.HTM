These efforts, termed the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) and Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2), acquired deep ice cores from on and near the Greenland summit.  A wide range of environmental and physical parameters (ecm, ions, isotopes, etc.) were measured in each of the cores along with present day meteorological conditions.  This data provides information that has helped investigators piece together past environmental changes which could shed light on possible future scenarios.  The GISP2 site was located at 72<sup>o</sup> 36' N, 38<sup>o</sup> 30' W.  The GRIP site was located at 72<sup>o</sup> 35' N, 37<sup>o</sup> 38' W.<p>The <a href = "tablecon.htm">contents of this CD-ROM</a> provides ice core information from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) and the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) efforts.  Searching and graphing (Macintosh and PC only) capabilities are additional features included with this product.  This CD-ROM was created in conjunction with the Journal of Geophysical Research (JGR) Joint Issue (Atmospheres and Oceans) on the Greenland Ice Cores, 1997, vol. 2.  Please refer to the JGR publication for articles about the data and information included here.  A complete listing of the JGR Joint Issue authorship and article information can be found under <a href = "tablecon.htm">contents of this CD-ROM</a>.<p>The GRIP and GISP2 data presented on this CD-ROM were acquired as a part of a multi-institutional effort involving the GISP2 Science Management Office (SMO) at the University of New Hampshire, the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Data Coordination Center (ADCC) at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the International Ice Core Data Cooperative (IICDC) at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), and the World Data Center-A (WDC-A) for Paleoclimatology at the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC).<p>Documentation, CD-ROM format and structure, artwork and data format were carried out jointly by NSIDC and the WDC-A for Paleoclimatology.  All GISP2 and GRIP data are jointly archived at the ADCC at NSIDC and at the WDC-A for Paleoclimatology, NOAA-NGDC.<p>All data and information used from this CD-ROM should be properly cited.
